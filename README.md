# Using the Modulus (%)
<br/>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Java has one important arithmetical operator you may not be familiar with,&nbsp;<code>%</code>, also known as the modulus or remainder operator. The&nbsp;<code>%</code>&nbsp;operator returns the remainder of two numbers. For instance&nbsp;<code>10 % 3</code>&nbsp;is 1 because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. You can use&nbsp;<code>%</code>&nbsp;just as you might use any other more common operator like&nbsp;<code>+</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>-</code>.</span></p>
